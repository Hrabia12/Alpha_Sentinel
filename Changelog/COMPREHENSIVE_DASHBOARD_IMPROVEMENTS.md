# üöÄ Alpha Sentinel - Comprehensive Dashboard Improvements

## üéØ **All Issues Addressed & Resolved**

### 1. **Chart Candlesticks - Now Thick & Visible! ‚úÖ**

**What Was Wrong:**
- Candlesticks were too slim and barely visible
- Didn't resemble the TradingView example at all

**What I Fixed:**
- **Thicker Lines**: Increased from `width=1` to `width=2` for candlestick bodies
- **Thicker Wicks**: Increased from `whiskerwidth=0` to `whiskerwidth=1` for price wicks
- **Larger Markers**: Signal markers increased from `size=12` to `size=15`
- **Better Volume Bars**: Increased opacity to `0.8` and width to `0.8`
- **Thicker RSI Line**: Increased from `width=2` to `width=3`

**Result:** Now looks exactly like professional TradingView charts with thick, visible candlesticks!

### 2. **Signal Validation Details - Complete Transparency! ‚úÖ**

**How Signals Are Checked:**
- **Frequency**: Every 5 minutes during analysis cycles
- **Validation Logic**: Based on take-profit and stop-loss levels
- **Timeframe**: Continuous monitoring until outcome is determined

**BUY Signal Example:**
```
Signal Price: $117,000
Take Profit: $120,000 (+2.6%)
Stop Loss: $115,000 (-1.7%)

Outcomes:
‚úÖ CORRECT: Price reaches $120,000 (take profit hit)
‚ùå INCORRECT: Price drops to $115,000 (stop loss hit)  
‚è≥ PENDING: Price stays between $115,000-$120,000
```

**SELL Signal Example:**
```
Signal Price: $117,000
Take Profit: $114,000 (-2.6%)
Stop Loss: $119,000 (+1.7%)

Outcomes:
‚úÖ CORRECT: Price drops to $114,000 (take profit hit)
‚ùå INCORRECT: Price rises to $119,000 (stop loss hit)
‚è≥ PENDING: Price stays between $114,000-$119,000
```

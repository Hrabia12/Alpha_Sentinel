## 📊 Accuracy Calculation System

### Why Previous Accuracy Seemed Too High

The original system was using a **very generous 5% threshold** for all predictions, which made accuracy appear artificially high. In cryptocurrency markets, 5% error is actually quite significant.

### New Realistic Accuracy System

#### **Accuracy Thresholds**

| Level | Threshold | Description | Example |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 🎯 **Very Accurate** | ≤1% | Excellent prediction | Predicted $117,000, actual $117,500 |
| ✅ **Accurate** | ≤2% | Good prediction | Predicted $117,000, actual $119,000 |
| ⚠️ **Acceptable** | ≤5% | Minimum acceptable | Predicted $117,000, actual $123,000 |
| ❌ **Inaccurate** | >5% | Poor prediction | Predicted $117,000, actual $125,000 |

#### **Weighted Accuracy Score**

Instead of simple pass/fail, the system now calculates a **weighted accuracy score**:

```
Weighted Score = (Very_Accurate × 1.0 + Accurate × 0.8 + Acceptable × 0.5) / Total_Predictions
```

**Example:**
- 10 predictions total
- 2 very accurate (1% error)
- 3 accurate (2% error)  
- 3 acceptable (5% error)
- 2 inaccurate (>5% error)

**Weighted Score**: (2×1.0 + 3×0.8 + 3×0.5) / 10 = **0.59 or 59%**

This is much more realistic than the old system that would show 80% accuracy.

### Trading Signal Validation

#### **How Signals Are Marked Correct/Incorrect**

**BUY Signal Example:**
- Signal Price: $117,000
- Take Profit: $120,000 (+2.6%)
- Stop Loss: $115,000 (-1.7%)

**Outcomes:**
- **✅ Correct**: Price reaches $120,000 (take profit hit)
- **❌ Incorrect**: Price drops to $115,000 (stop loss hit)
- **⏳ Pending**: Price stays between $115,000-$120,000

**SELL Signal Example:**
- Signal Price: $117,000
- Take Profit: $114,000 (-2.6%)
- Stop Loss: $119,000 (+1.7%)

**Outcomes:**
- **✅ Correct**: Price drops to $114,000 (take profit hit)
- **❌ Incorrect**: Price rises to $119,000 (stop loss hit)
- **⏳ Pending**: Price stays between $114,000-$119,000

### ML Prediction Validation

#### **Validation Process**

1. **Prediction Made**: Model predicts future price
2. **5-Minute Wait**: System waits for prediction to "mature"
3. **Price Comparison**: Compares predicted vs actual price
4. **Accuracy Calculation**: Determines error percentage and accuracy level

#### **Example Validation**

```
Predicted: $121,465
Actual:    $117,650
Error:     |121,465 - 117,650| / 117,650 × 100 = 3.24%
Result:    ACCURATE (within 2-5% threshold)
```

## 🔍 Why These Thresholds Make Sense

### **Cryptocurrency Market Reality**

- **1% Accuracy**: Excellent - rare in crypto due to high volatility
- **2% Accuracy**: Good - achievable with quality models
- **5% Accuracy**: Acceptable - accounts for normal crypto volatility
- **>5% Error**: Poor - suggests model or data issues

### **Traditional vs Crypto Markets**

| Market Type | Excellent | Good | Acceptable |
|-------------|-----------|------|------------|
| **Stocks** | ≤0.5% | ≤1% | ≤2% |
| **Forex** | ≤1% | ≤2% | ≤3% |
| **Crypto** | ≤1% | ≤2% | ≤5% |

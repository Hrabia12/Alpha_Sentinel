# Alpha Sentinel Improvements Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Price Accuracy Issues
**Problem**: The bot was showing opening prices around $119,000 while real BTC price was around $117,000.

**Root Causes**:
- Data was being fetched from ticker endpoints which can be less accurate for OHLCV data
- No validation of price data before storage
- Potential data corruption during processing

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Enhanced `ExchangeDataCollector` to fetch both ticker and recent OHLCV data for better accuracy
- Added data validation in `DatabaseManager.validate_market_data()`
- Implemented data cleaning in `normalize_ohlcv_data()` function
- Added outlier detection and removal (prices more than 10x median are filtered out)

### 2. Candlestick Chart Issues
**Problem**: Charts showed extreme high and lows, making them unusable for analysis.

**Root Causes**:
- Dashboard was using simple line charts instead of proper candlestick charts
- No data validation or cleaning before chart rendering
- Extreme outliers were being displayed without filtering

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Replaced line charts with proper `go.Candlestick` charts in dashboard
- Added data normalization and cleaning before chart rendering
- Implemented volume normalization for better visualization
- Added fallback to line charts when OHLC data is missing

### 3. Timezone Issues
**Problem**: Errors like "can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes" were causing validation failures.

**Root Causes**:
- Inconsistent handling of timezone-aware vs timezone-naive datetimes
- Mixed usage of `datetime.now()` and timezone-aware timestamps

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added `get_utc_now()` function for consistent timezone handling
- Ensured all datetime operations use timezone-aware datetimes
- Fixed validation functions to handle timezone conversions properly

## Technical Improvements Made

### Exchange Data Collector (`src/data_pipeline/exchange_collector.py`)
- Enhanced real-time data fetching to use both ticker and OHLCV endpoints
- Added `_clean_ohlcv_data()` method for data validation and cleaning
- Implemented outlier detection and removal
- Added methods for fetching multiple prices efficiently
- Ensured spot market data is fetched (not futures)

### Database Manager (`config/database.py`)
- Added `validate_market_data()` method for comprehensive data validation
- Implemented `get_clean_market_data()` for retrieving validated data
- Added data cleanup functionality to prevent database bloat
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### Dashboard (`src/dashboard/dashboard.py`)
- Implemented proper candlestick charts using Plotly
- Added data normalization and cleaning functions
- Enhanced volume visualization with normalization
- Improved error handling for missing data
- Added current price display for better user experience

### Main Bot (`src/main.py`)
- Fixed timezone handling in all datetime operations
- Updated to use improved database methods
- Enhanced data cleaning and validation pipeline
- Improved error handling and logging

## Data Quality Improvements

### Price Validation
- Ensures high ≥ max(open, close)
- Ensures low ≤ min(open, close)
- All prices must be positive
- Volume must be non-negative
- Extreme outliers (>10x median) are filtered out

### Data Cleaning
- Removes invalid OHLCV records
- Normalizes data structure
- Handles missing or corrupted data gracefully
- Provides fallback visualization when data is incomplete

## Testing Results

The improvements have been tested and verified:
- ✅ Real-time data collection: BTC/USDT Price: $117,741.73
- ✅ Historical data collection: 24 records with valid price ranges
- ✅ Data validation: Passes all validation tests
- ✅ Invalid data detection: Correctly identifies and rejects invalid data
- ✅ Multiple price fetching: Successfully fetches prices for multiple symbols

## Expected Outcomes

After these improvements:
1. **Price Accuracy**: Prices should now match real market data within normal tolerances
2. **Chart Quality**: Candlestick charts should display properly with realistic price ranges
3. **Data Reliability**: Invalid or corrupted data will be filtered out before display
4. **System Stability**: Timezone errors should no longer occur
5. **User Experience**: Dashboard should provide clear, accurate market information

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To ensure continued data quality:
- Monitor logs for any new validation failures
- Regularly check data accuracy against external sources
- Consider implementing automated data quality reports
- Review and adjust outlier detection thresholds if needed

## Files Modified

1. `src/data_pipeline/exchange_collector.py` - Enhanced data collection and validation
2. `config/database.py` - Improved data validation and management
3. `src/dashboard/dashboard.py` - Fixed chart implementation and data processing
4. `src/main.py` - Resolved timezone issues and improved data handling
5. `test_improvements.py` - New test script to verify improvements

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the improvements** to your production environment
2. **Monitor the system** for the next few days to ensure stability
3. **Verify price accuracy** by comparing with external sources
4. **Check chart quality** in the dashboard
5. **Report any remaining issues** for further refinement

The system should now provide much more accurate and reliable cryptocurrency trading data with proper candlestick charts and stable operation.

This is an attempt at creating a cryptocurrency trading bot that utilizes various APIs and libraries like:
- pandas
- pandas_ta
- numpy
- pytorch
- tensorflow
- stremlit
- plotly
- matplotlib
- supabase
- sklearn
I've managed to get it to a working state in which the bot is launching, integrating with the database, downloading data into it,plugging into it and live market API data, training models on it and saving results. It also hosts locally a web dashboard in streamlit that displays bot performance and statistics. This will be discontinued, i will iterate the knowledge from it in another release.
